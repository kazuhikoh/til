== 画面遷移時のデータ受渡し

Pass data between destinations
https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data

> In general, you should strongly prefer passing only the minimal amount of data between destinations.
> For example, you should pass a key to retrieve an object rather than passing the object itself,
> as the total space for all saved states is limited on Android.
> If you need to pass large amounts of data, consider using a ViewModel as described in Share data between fragments.

* 受け渡しは最小限のデータにすべき (渡せる容量が限られているから)
* たくさんのデータを渡したいなら、 `ViewModel` を使う
